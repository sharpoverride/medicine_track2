# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medicine Track API is a comprehensive medication management system that enables users to track their medications, schedules, dosing logs, and potential drug interactions. The system provides a RESTful API for managing personal medication regimens with features for medication database lookup, interaction checking, and detailed logging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to manage my medication list, so that I can keep track of all my prescribed and over-the-counter medications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new medication THEN the system SHALL store the medication with all required details including name, strength, form, and dosing schedules
2. WHEN a user requests their medication list THEN the system SHALL return all active medications with optional filtering by status and search terms
3. WHEN a user updates a medication THEN the system SHALL modify the existing medication record and maintain audit timestamps
4. WHEN a user deletes a medication THEN the system SHALL archive the medication (soft delete) rather than permanently removing it
5. IF a medication has an end date THEN the system SHALL consider it for archival after that date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to define flexible dosing schedules for my medications, so that I can track complex medication regimens accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a medication schedule THEN the system SHALL support multiple frequency types including daily, weekly, monthly, as-needed, every X days, specific days of week, every X weeks, and every X months
2. WHEN defining a schedule THEN the system SHALL allow multiple times of day for each medication
3. WHEN specifying dosage THEN the system SHALL store quantity and unit information for each scheduled dose
4. IF a medication has multiple schedules THEN the system SHALL maintain all schedules independently
5. WHEN updating schedules THEN the system SHALL preserve existing schedule history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to log when I take my medications, so that I can track my adherence and share accurate information with healthcare providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging a medication dose THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp, status (taken/skipped/as-needed), quantity taken, and optional notes
2. WHEN retrieving medication logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, medication, and status
3. WHEN updating a log entry THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all log fields while preserving the original logged timestamp
4. IF a log is associated with a schedule THEN the system SHALL maintain the schedule reference
5. WHEN deleting a log THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the log entry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to search for medications in a database, so that I can accurately add medications with correct information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching the medication database THEN the system SHALL return matching medications with NDC codes, generic names, brand names, available forms, and strengths
2. WHEN filtering search results THEN the system SHALL support filtering by medication form and strength
3. IF multiple brand names exist THEN the system SHALL return all available brand names for a medication
4. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL include manufacturer information where available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to check for potential drug interactions, so that I can identify dangerous medication combinations before taking them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking interactions THEN the system SHALL analyze combinations of existing medications and new medications
2. WHEN interactions are found THEN the system SHALL return warnings with severity levels (high, moderate, low, unknown)
3. WHEN displaying interaction warnings THEN the system SHALL include detailed descriptions and data sources
4. IF no interactions are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty warnings list
5. WHEN checking multiple medications THEN the system SHALL evaluate all possible combinations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to provide proper error handling and validation, so that the system remains stable and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.)
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field information
3. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 status with clear error messages
4. IF server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 status codes with appropriate error handling
5. WHEN successful operations complete THEN the system SHALL return appropriate success status codes (200, 201, 204)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand and implement all available endpoints correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN reviewing endpoints THEN the system SHALL group related functionality with appropriate tags
3. WHEN examining request/response formats THEN the system SHALL provide clear data models and examples
4. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL document authentication requirements
5. WHEN testing the API THEN the system SHALL provide a health check endpoint

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a patient, I want my medication data to be properly organized by user, so that my information remains private and separate from other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any medication data THEN the system SHALL require a valid user ID in the request path
2. WHEN storing medication information THEN the system SHALL associate all data with the correct user ID
3. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL only return information belonging to the specified user
4. IF a user ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN performing operations THEN the system SHALL maintain data isolation between different users
